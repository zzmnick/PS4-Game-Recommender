This directory contains all the files related to the recommender model:

'model_building_and_training.ipynb' contains all the code we used for building, training and testing the model. It also contains the output of our tests

'model_param.pickle' contains the parameters of our model from the best training run. This file is a binary file and can only be read in python as a pytorch model object using the pickle library

Note: This model works but is slightly outdated since it was an intermediate step for our project. Please refer to the directory backend/controllers/game_recognition_model for the most up-to-date model.
