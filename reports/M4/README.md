Milestone M4 report

Current State of the Project:
In this final milestone, our team has achieved all of the major goals that we have set in the proposal. We were able to successfully establish a smooth working connection between the app frontend and the backend. Furthermore, we have successfully deployed our backend server onto the Compute Engine of Google Cloud, so the user can use the app anywhere without needing to worry about the backend. This has also helped us decrease the processing time of the app.

In addition, we made some cosmetic as well as functional changes to the app based on the app’s current performance. Most of this milestone involved testing and debugging our app’s UI as well as the get/post requests to the backend. In doing so, we have ensured that our app works properly with any possible inputs and on many different Android devices. Finally, the team worked together on the final report and the video to describe the architecture of the app and all the major components in detail, and to demonstrate the app in operation.

Feature Changes to the Proposal:
-    In previous milestone reports, we mentioned that we planned to include an intermediate step where the user will have a chance to look at the predictions that the game recognition model makes and choose to enter the game title as text if the prediction was wrong. However, upon testing our app, we realized that our recognition model works very well for most of the cases, so we decided to scrap this idea to avoid unnecessary confusions for the user. Instead, we decided to just display the predictions and confidence and directly continue to display the recommended game titles.

Current Challenges/Bottlenecks:
-    Since this was the final milestone and we already have a fully working app, we do not have any unhandled bottlenecks / challenges.
