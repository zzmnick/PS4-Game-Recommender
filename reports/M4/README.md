Milestone M4 report

Current State of the Project:
In this final milestone, our team has achieved most of what we set out to. We were able to successfully establish a smooth working connection between the app frontend and the backend. Furthermore, we decided to deploy it to the Compute Engine (only the backend) of Google Cloud as we observed that it increased the processing time of the app. 

In addition, the team made some cosmetic as well as functional changes to the app based on the app’s current performance. In addition, the majority of this milestone involved testing and debugging our app’s UI as well as the get/post requests to the backend. In doing so, we have got our application ready for the final submission and a working demo for the video. Finally, the team worked together on the final report and described the working of the app, ML/Non-ML components, and other major components in great detail.

Feature Changes to the Proposal:
-    In previous milestone reports, we mentioned that we planned to include an intermediate step where the user will have a chance to look at the predictions that the game recognition model makes. This functionality meant that they could enter the game title as text if the prediction was wrong, however upon testing our app, we realized that our app works well and so we decided to scrap this idea. Instead, we would just display the prediction and accuracy and continue to recommend the new game titles.

Current Challenges/Bottlenecks:
-    Since this was the final milestone and a working app was required by the end of this deadline, we do not have any unhandled bottlenecks / challenges.
